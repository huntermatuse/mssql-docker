# ghcr.io/huntermatuse/mssql-docker

## MSSQL Docker Image

The purpose of this image is to provide a quick way to spin up docker containers that include some necessary creature comforts for automatically spinning up databases, restoring backups, and version controlling sql scripts.

This image is automatically built for the latest `mssql/server:2025` version on amd64. New versions will be updated, but any features are subject to change with later versions. Upon a new pull request, if a valid build file is modified, it will trigger a build test pipeline that verifies the image still operates as expected.

If using a Windows device, you will want to [Set up WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

## Getting the Docker Imgage

1. The user must have a local personal access token to authenticate to the Github Repository. For details on how to authenticate to the Github Repository, see the [Github Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry#authenticating-with-a-personal-access-token-classic).

1. This docker image is uploaded to the github container registry, and can be pulled with the following:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/huntermatuse/mssql-docker:latest
```

## Customizations

This is a derived image of the Microsoft `mssql/server:2025` image. Please see the [Microsoft SQL Server on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/mssql-server) for more information on the base image. This image should be able to take all arguments provided by the base image, but has not been tested.

### Simulated Data Insertion

This image will automatically insert simulated data into the database if the `INSERT_SIMULATED_DATA` environment variable is set to `true`. This is useful for testing purposes, but should not be used in production. To make these files available to the image, you can mount a volume to `/simulated-data`. The files should be in the `.sql` format and contain any necessary `INSERT` statements. The files will be executed in alphabetical order.

### Environment Variables

This image also preloads the following environment variables by default:
| Environment Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `ACCEPT_EULA` | `Y` |
| `SA_PASSWORD` | `Str0ng!Passw0rd` |
| `MSSQL_PID` | `Developer` |
| `INSERT_SIMULATED_DATA` | `false` |
